# PurpleBug-Exam
Exam for PurpleBug by Marionne Virgil Quintana

Implemented Extra Credit:
-Three or more distinct consecutive levels, with increasing difficulty
-Custom visuals and shaders
-Custom soundtracks and SFX

I have implemented these three because I have previous knowledge on how to implement them. Due to time constraints, I believe that it would be most efficient to 
implement the features that I already have knowledge on. Also, I have designed my gameobject heirachy structure to be "reusable" and can be easily used to create 
new levels. 

Note: The following assets are used from the following sources:

-BGM - zapsplat.com
-Tile Palette (environment only) - Unity asset store - Aekiro

The rest of the assets are created by me.
